- Classes inheriting from DomainEventBase<TId> need to have an internal empty constructor
- Classes inheriting from AggregateRootBase<TId> meant for use with the event store, need to have a private empty constructor
- Commands and queries should implement IRequest and IHandler respectively
- Data-only (persistence-related) models should implement IDataEntity<TId>
- Aggregate roots should implement IAggregateRoot<T, TId>
